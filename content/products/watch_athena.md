In this model, SWIZA, better than anyone else, has been able to interpret the concept of "suspended movement": the watch appears to be floating in a vacuum.

The frame is made of solid brass and hand polished and skillfully finished.

The glass on the side and front are of crystal and the back which contains the movement is of unbreakable glass.

A masterpiece of Swiss clock makers and named after Athena, the Goddess of art and craftsmanship from ancient Greece.

The clock is new in the package. With user guide and a special cloth to clean the exterior.

With the original box and certificate.
