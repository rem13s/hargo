Face shows “MCMXLVII MCMLXXII SILVER ANNIVERSARY” and a left facing portrait of both Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip.

Obverse shows the Royal Coat of Arms, flanked by the individual royal cyphers of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. 

All the items listed are part of my personal collection.
