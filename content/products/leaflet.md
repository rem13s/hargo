Opinions can of course be divided about this historical memorial sheet - but one thing is certain: it was published on behalf of the Winter Relief Organization at the time. This is a real original, with which the field postmaster of the Rommel Army recorded all historical data on this unique memorial sheet during the advance and retreat. It is also important that this really is a real contemporary document from this period, with real original stamps, on which only the explanatory text was subsequently imprinted.

At the bottom of the Winterhilfswerk memorial sheet you will find a facsimile signature of Field Marshal Rommel.

Originally, 2.200 such Winterhilfswerk memorial sheets were to be created - but the waste and ongoing damage ultimately led to a reduction of 2.000 copies, which are hardly to be found today.

* On the front page (Day of the Wehrmacht 1940) you will find the stamp of the Rommel Army staff unit.
* On the back it continues (top left) with the invasion of France, documented by two French stamps dated May 10, 1940.
* The postmark of the Post Office of Catania of April 20 1941 was added when the Africa Corps was transferring from Sicily to North Africa .
* The Day of the Wehrmacht is documented by the special postmark from Tripoli.
* On June 21, 1942, a captured British Army service postmark with the inscription "Army Signals", the conquest of Tobruk .
* Another booty stamp of Arab origin was added after the conquest of Abu-Hagag in El Alamein.
* This was followed by the retreat to Tunisia in 1943, evidenced by the French stamp of Gabes.
* And finally the loss of the Africa bridgehead , expressed by the Italian stamp "Posta Militare" dated April 20, 1943
