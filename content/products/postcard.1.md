Colorful postcard featuring typical anti Bolshevik slogan " Bolschewismus Ohne Maske" (Bolshevism Unmasked) with an illustration of a Communist soldier attempting to rule the world with a hammer and sickle against the backdrop of a yellow star of David, implying the opinion that Jews were behind the Communist phenomenon. Communism is depicted as the Death wearing Soviet uniform and controlling the world. Communist symbol of the sickle and the hammer and star of David are painted overlapped.  

On the reverse there are 2 ink stamps about the anti-Bolsheviki exhibition in Vienna in 1939. (Maschinenstempel aus WIEN-NORDWESTBAHNHALLE mit Werbeeinsatz: Grosse Antibolschewistische Ausstellung Wien 07.01.1939)
